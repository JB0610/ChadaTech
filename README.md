# ChadaTech


Chada Tech is a software engineering company specializing in custom software design and development for domestic and international clients. You read more about the company and decide this place would be an excellent fit for you. You are also happy to find an opening for a junior developer and apply for the position immediately. The skills that you have acquired at SNHU have prepared you for this role. Consequently, you are selected for an interview!

As part of the Chada Tech interview process, you are asked to complete a coding skills test to “audition” for the role. This is a typical interviewing strategy that you may encounter in the field. Companies utilize this technique to ensure candidates can do what they claim they can do. Therefore, this exercise will be based on a problem similar to what you will face in the junior developer role, and you will need to come up with a solution. This is your chance to show them what you can do!

The Chada Tech interviewing team has provided you with the following problem statement and a document containing a set of functional requirements:

Chada Tech has domestic and international clients. To meet international standard ISO 8601, Chada Tech wants their clients to be able to view a 12- and a 24-hour clock on their website rather than just the standard 12-hour clock.

To stand out as a top candidate, I must apply program logic by creating two simultaneous display clocks and allowing user input using secure and efficient C++ code.

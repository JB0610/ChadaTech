# ChadaTech


Chada Tech is a software engineering company specializing in custom software design and development for domestic and international clients.

The Chada Tech interviewing team has provided the following problem statement and a document containing a set of functional requirements:

Chada Tech has domestic and international clients. To meet international standard ISO 8601, Chada Tech wants their clients to be able to view a 12- and a 24-hour clock on their website rather than just the standard 12-hour clock.

To stand out as a top candidate, I must apply program logic by creating two simultaneous display clocks and allowing user input using secure and efficient C++ code.
